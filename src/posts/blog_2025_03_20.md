## <a id="newest-rookie">`NEWEST ROOKIE`</a>

STARDOM's third rookie making their debut this year is 26 year old Anne Kanaya (ÈáëÂ±ã„ÅÇ„Çì„Å≠) from Urasoe, Okinawa.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDwkYWsUc4vWrbWbUx8j6lk-KMe8hHM8/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

[They have a background in swimming, tennis, and soccer and got into watching pro-wrestling in YouTube from her days in high school. That interest cooled a bit when she entered the workforce. One day she was watching TV Asahi's Puroresu Sousenkyo („Éó„É≠„É¨„ÇπÁ∑èÈÅ∏Êåô) where she got a little introduction to STARDOM after seeing Starlight Kid. Her interest was back again and she had a chance to watch NJPW and STARDOM's collaboration show (Historic X-Over). She finally entered the STARDOM dojo around November 2023](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/337419).

[![20250315-anne-kanaya.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SQ6gYhTm/20250315-anne-kanaya.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/JthNS9CF)

Anne will have her debut match against Yuna Mizumori in the first day of the Okinawa tour where she will go under "Tropical Examination".

[![20250315-anne-yunamon.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHQB3RcF/20250315-anne-yunamon.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/ZB5Nty2N)

## <a id="crazy-star">`CRAZY STAR IMPLODING??`</a>

The loss from NEO GENESIS was caused by multiple miscommunications between Mei Seira and Suzu Suzuki which lead to accidental friendly-fire. Suzu was very frustrated at Mei and couldn't make a comment after the match.

[![20250315-mei-suzu-top.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/7Pc45qjf/20250315-mei-suzu-top.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hh96wRDB)

Days prior to this match, they did one of their usual Instagram livestreams where they just hang out. Apparently near the end, both started arguing about their tag team and the lack of success recently. Suzu even bringing up the fact that Mei & Kohaku teamed up to challenge for the WAVE Tag Team titles a few weeks ago. From the [clip I've seen](https://x.com/s25yBNdR7d34150/status/1900188518090969425), Suzu seemed to have abruptly ended the feed out of frustration. The chat was visibly worried about it the whole time. Suzu certainly has been a little jealous about everyone in her faction winning titles while she just lost both of her recent title opportunities.

Things will definitely get more interesting as they team up on both days in Okinawa.

## <a id="iwgp">`IWGP MAYU X SYURI`</a>

Syuri has earned another title shot against Mayu Iwatani for the IWGP Women's Championship after pinning her. It has been over a year since Mayu defeated Syuri to defend the title and has gone on in a long defense road for almost 2 years.

[![20250315-syuri-mayu.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF36Y1z6/20250315-syuri-mayu.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zHkbFR5v)

Just last week, Syuri went up against Sareee in a match that was promoted to determine the next challenger for the IWGP Women's title. Sareee also failed to beat Mayu last year for the title and has been doing great work to earn another opportunity. It unfortunately reached a time limit draw.

[![20250310-syuri-sareee-tld.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/5twdGvtz/20250310-syuri-sareee-tld.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/d7txZhrQ)

Now, Syuri has gotten ahead of Sareee and is now facing Mayu once more for All Star Grand Queendom this April.

[![20250427-mayu-syuri-card.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1zMVpgZG/20250427-mayu-syuri-card.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/KKkYb8jj)

## <a id="saori">`SAORI'S OPPORTUNITY`</a>

Unagi Sayaka made a surprise appearance after the COSMIC ANGELS tag match to promote her upcoming produce show in Ryogoku Sumo Hall on April 26th (day before All Star Grand Queendom). This was the first time we saw Unagi since they previously lost to Tam Nakano back in early January that got her exiled from competing in here. She invited Saori Anou into a healthy sandals match for that produce show where she will team up with herself and Risa Sera against BJW's Daisuke Sekimoto and two mystery people who are yet to be decided. Saori [participated in a similar match during Unagi's previous produce show](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/315340).

[![20250315-unagi-slipper.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/h48jRWN6/20250315-unagi-slipper.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HjxHbKY9)
[![20250315-unagi-saori-slipper.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNyKy1hs/20250315-unagi-saori-slipper.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qg5rwLgV)

Tam and Unagi may even meet each other in the ring again soon.

[![20250315-unagi-tam.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RhwGXVFM/20250315-unagi-tam.png)](https://postimg.cc/jndzjTP9)

As time keeps getting closer to the loser retires match, Saori Anou took the opportunity to finally have a singles match with Tam. It now has been confirmed for the Korakuen Hall show on April 2nd.

[![20250315-saori-tam.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/65YpTVWh/20250315-saori-tam.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zVHrcgRL)

## <a id="thekla-okataro">`THEKLA WANTS THE PRESIDENT`</a>

Thekla has won the right to pick anyone in STARDOM she can have a singles match after defeating Mina Shirakawa.

[![20250315-thekla-spear.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/3RmqWHGD/20250315-thekla-spear.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HcWzPRBp)

They chose to call out STARDOM President Taro Okada.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ex4Pbmo6_nloU9JvBGLDOWmLD8BbeRuv/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

She has been suspended multiple times within a span of a year due to multiple different incidents including hurting staff members and also not paying fines. Even assaulting president Okada just last week and now we may have reached her final plan. As of right now, it hasn't been confirmed if this will really happen.

[![20250315-okataro.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6qKmv1Vb/20250315-okataro.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YGXRcRsQ)

## <a id="slk-konami">`STARLIGHT KID CLAIMS V2`</a>

Starlight Kid survived Konami's onslaught and defeated her to successfully defend white belt for the 2nd time.

[![20250315_slk_wins.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bwQTyB8s/20250315_slk_wins.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/21SvTT1D)

SLK was met with the black spray all over her face & mask and powerful kicks to the head which lead up to her nose bleeding heavily.

[![20250315_slk_konami_knee.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/WzWy7ft2/20250315_slk_konami_knee.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wRNFq2hP)

Despite competing with a shoulder injury (that she sustained during Barb Sasaki's Crazy Fest on the 10th, leading her to pull out of SSPW's show on the 13th), she still managed to secure the V2.

[![20250315_slk_muff.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/2y6c3FGg/20250315_slk_muff.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bD7HBnKR)

She will be off the cards in Okinawa to recover from the injuries and postpone the scheduled special singles match against World Of Stardom champion Saya Kamitani who wants her to be in better condition.

[![20250315-slk-kamitani.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zBD3Bdm8/20250315-slk-kamitani.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/2qJC978K)

## <a id="kurara-cinderella">`KURARA WINS THE CINDERELLA`</a>

Sayaka Kurara has become this year's Cinderella winner after defeating Azusa Inaba in the semi-final, then achieving a big upset by defeating Rina (who beat last year's Cinderella winner Hanan prior to this) in the grand finale.

[![20250315-kurara-spear.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/9QTx4fPX/20250315-kurara-spear.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/18m02sYb)

Breaking the record for the shortest time between their debut and becoming a 1st time winner with 446 days (December, 25, 2023 - March, 15, 2025). A record that was previously held by Saya Kamitani with 673 days (August, 10, 2019 - June, 12, 2021). While the winners usually say their wish while wearing their beautiful Cinderella dress, Kurara chose not to say hers on the spot. Instead, she will tell us when the time is right.

[![20250315-kurara-vulcan.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xTBxTmzF/20250315-kurara-vulcan.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/6yLLMyzd)

Now that Saya Kamitani's upcoming match with SLK has been postponed, they has pointed the crosshair at Kurara once again going into the Okinawa tour. Last time they met in the ring, Kurara chose the path that was meant to symbolize their future by leaving behind the love for Kamitani and siding with her mentor Tam Nakano. Since then, Tam is now a freelancer and is at risk with Kamitani of retirement. From here, we'll see how Kurara will be able to protect Tam and stand up to anyone who's in her way while that wish lingers.
