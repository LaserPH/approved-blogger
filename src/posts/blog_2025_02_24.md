# PATH OF THUNDER

Path Of Thunder will be held in Light Cube Utsunomiya located in Utsunomiya City, Tochigi. Not only is it a special PPV event, it's also a homecoming show for the 3 sisters of STARDOM (Hanan, Rina, Hina) who all have title matches in the show. New rookie Yuria Hime who is an Utsunomiya native will be facing Mayu Iwatani in her own special singles match. The biggest story leading into this show has been the continuation of the chaos between Saya Kamitani and Tam Nakano with the custody of Sayaka Kurara now included in the mix.

## `WHITE TIGER'S 1ST DEFENSE`

On home turf, Rina will get her first opportunity for the Wonder Of Stardom title. It will also be her first singles match against Starlight Kid.

[![20250126-rina-slk.png](https://i.postimg.cc/66GDMVr4/20250126-rina-slk.png)](https://postimg.cc/NLBJMHPQ)

She recently secured her #1 contendership after defeating Saori Anou who was destined to face SLK once again.

[![20250126-rana-victorious.png](https://i.postimg.cc/d38NwB6W/20250126-rana-victorious.png)](https://postimg.cc/hQt10VHx)

Rina has achieved great success in the past year after achieving 12 successful defenses in a 512 day record-breaking reign as Future Of Stardom champion while also still attending high school. Now having earned this big shot, she sets to win something her mentor, the late Hana Kimura has chased but never won.

[![20250224-rina-hana.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/y83N9NnF/20250224-rina-hana.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qN00H4PR)

The champion made her own preparations by analyzing Rina's matches in her notebook. Wearing a high school uniform supposedly cuter than Rina's to trigger her. She used to view Rina like a little sister during her time in the now defunct Oedo Tai. She acknowledged Rina's recent growth as scary, with a win over Saori Anou to add on top of that whom she has never beaten herself.

[![20250215-slk.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sgn6j1PR/20250215-slk.png)](https://postimg.cc/JskcKrdT)

However, she plans to show that there's still much more to climb and pain to experience in order to reach the stage of winning the White belt. A test to decide if she'll be able to make the belt "bloom" and shine the brightest. Writing down in calligraphy the word "[咲く](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%92%B2%E3%81%8F)" (saku) to convey this and even lending a helping hand to Rina in order for her to reach her peak.

[![mpv-shot0010.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/02Fk8sxr/mpv-shot0010.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/rKGXJ7DL)

Rina did not react to this positively. Hitting Starlight Kid and dumping all the calligraphy ink on her uniform. Willing to crush and humiliate those who try stoop above her level. Focused on cutting SLK's defense road short with just one shot and even become the youngest Wonder Of Stardom champion (record currently held by Momo Watanabe).

[![20250220-rina-ink.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L80DdwR9/20250220-rina-ink.png)](https://postimg.cc/VJnnn7dp)

Hopefully their own words live up to what will be an important fight.

## `"KURARA"`

After Saya Kamitani successfully made her 1st defense of World Of Stardom title against Suzu Suzuki, Tam Nakano came out to challenge. Saya instead proposed a tag match between her and someone from H.A.T.E. (Tora was decided later) against Tam and Sayaka Kurara. If Tam wins, she will grant any wish. If not, she will take claim Kurara as hers and join H.A.T.E.. Saya's plan to tear apart everything of Tam Nakano did not end at DREAM QUEENDOM.

[![20250202-kurara-saya.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zGvgQ57B/20250202-kurara-saya.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HrGnJqfD)

We've had a couple of teases for months about Kamitani's true intentions luring Kurara into her devious ways instead of going back to the Golden Phoenix that Kurara once admired when she debuted. Kurara still insists that her heart truly lies in Cosmic Angels and is here to protect Tam.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eu8qQNtW5YBPu17yD6IsWN0ww3lOWsKx/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Few days later, [Kamitani started claiming Kurara is being held hostage by Tam in a form of a one-sided relationship and thinks that the actual person she admires the most is her](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/332765). [Utilizing photos/screenshots taken by fans to support this agenda](https://x.com/saya_h_a_t_e/status/1886777931810365787).

[![20250205-kamitani-twitter.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FR5k1S4d/20250205-kamitani-twitter.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/B8pnVXt4)

[Tam responded back by saying that these instances were taken when Kurara is exhausted and even showed some proof of Kurara showing love back](https://x.com/tmtmtmx/status/1887403686579859517). Also stating that Kurara did not become a wrestler just to polish someone's boots and be treated like an object. [Kurara herself tried to clear the air with the same sentiment while thanking and respecting for her growth and development as a wrestler and that she would do anything to not make her sad.](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/333290)

[![20250206-tam-twitter.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/RF76t0SP/20250206-tam-twitter.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/Ppq5sT8Z)

On the 9th, Kurara teamed with her fellow faction mate Aya Sakura and lost due to miscommunication.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5AkMrWUs872vPhenGBQN-Ta-Dcrr7Wn/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Sakura does believe the bond between Kurara and Cosmic Angels is still strong. On the other hand, she wasn't sure if she could say the same with their tag team. Telling her that she will go with the path she believes in and do what she must do.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f2kGihXvlsaWDiOwU5C5cRUgBDguqa3J/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

A similar outcome happened on the 12th. Tam accidentally kicked Kurara in 2 different occasions, causing H.A.T.E. to capitalize over it for an easy win.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yRmXPcTEADrlpJuCxykx-zqv82v_dG_w/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Kamitani then made fun of the so-called bond in Cosmic Angels and continued to attract Kurara by exclaiming that she would love her more than Tam ever could if she came to her side. Aiming to dye that pure heart into darkness.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1noqHSYe2ipJG7WcPyrvojqWwwIAW3BX4/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Meanwhile, Saori Anou was talking to Aya Sakura in relation to the personal conflicts with Kurara. From what I could understand, she described the situation as similar to her relationship with Natsupoi who she had conflict with quite a lot in the past whose connection became stronger and more positive over time. Saori thinks the same turn of events could happen between the two. Aya's feelings does still feel uncertain.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKgmoVckbvxJQqtzyOxwOFeCGdF8BbOP/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

In an interview with Tokyo Sports, Tam revealed that the day after losing the red belt, Tam made her own Saya Kamitani doll out of spite similar to the Suzu Suzuki doll. It sits by her side when she sleeps everyday. Because of it, Kamitani comes into her dreams rubbing her "stinky feet" and licking her face. Its tongue grows longer bit by bit in a daily basis. No matter how much she cuts, it keeps growing back.

[![20250218-dolls.png](https://i.postimg.cc/28PDqwZj/20250218-dolls.png)](https://postimg.cc/sv98q5mb)

To end this, she now wants to cut Saya's tongue in Utsunomiya.

[![20250218-tongue-cut.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8PFGP3sn/20250218-tongue-cut.png)](https://postimg.cc/kBdzTTQx)

Saya reacted back with this video of her in front of a candle imitating Tam from the interview and licking her face on the Tokyo Sports print newspaper and destroying it.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lOR6N5n8FsBh5sIbaUxEh9SQJFgNydQN/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

The psychological warfare between these two have just become more unhinged over time and I don't think it's going to stop.

Should we trust Kurara?

Should we trust everyone else in COSMIC ANGELS?

Will Tam be able to protect Kurara from the wrath of the Phenex Queen?

We'll see.

## `WING☆GORI X CRAZY STAR`

wing☆gori (Hanan & Saya Iida) will be having their 1st defense against Crazy Star for the Goddesses Of Stardom title. Hanan & Saya Iida won these titles in the end of last year after [winning the Goddesses Of Stardom tag league](https://youtu.be/ya1kGcOzNJg?si=xdy1Q-TCSyzhfKAW&t=818) then [beating H.A.T.E. Supreme (Momo Watanabe & Thekla) in DREAM QUEENDOM](https://youtu.be/GaE5gmZB1U4?si=w357zvFWmDUDP8pT&t=90).

[![20250219-press-6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/X7vfZK0P/20250219-press-6.png)](https://postimg.cc/NLW9SHF8)

Crazy Star have won the titles early last year and successfully defended it twice before losing them to FWC (Hazuki & Koguma). They have also taken a loss to wing☆gori back in May before Suzu went out of action to recovery from injuries. Since NEO GENESIS won the New Year Unit League, they have taken a shot on the belts once again.

[![msedge-Qsg-IZz-Cjt-P.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FzHLLvwS/msedge-Qsg-IZz-Cjt-P.png)](https://postimg.cc/qhWRPPJB)

On the 16th, Iida removed the wrapping and displayed her right hand being "alright" in front of Suzu who has been in doubts that she's "ready". Suzu then slapped that hand to test it and hit it again when Iida spoke back.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uADmBbSBqh2knBHS36BoupOF8XKKXSCh/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

At the press conference, Suzu implied that wing☆gori have been too preoccupied with the current conflicts within STARS rather than looking forward to defending their titles. Iida then responded by saying that being the champion has broadened her perspective to the point that she can manage both the unit and being tag champs. Iida also keep insisting that the hand is already at 100%. Suzu of course did it again.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18yHOOjl601V_2IzUR2Vab3kACepuJMdw/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

On the other hand, Hanan and Mei Seira now want to have a singles match in the near future. As far as I know, [both had a match back in late 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/VD5VNBoAHWQ?si=425EfMHlD5hrE1Qt&t=3474) in a New Blood show which led to a draw and it has only been now going into this match where they been heating up again.

[![20250219-hanan-mei.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xjgqVhcb/20250219-hanan-mei.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9zRcGxPW)

It will be a very rough challenge for wing☆gori and truly a test if Hanan & Iida can do whatever it takes to stay on top and start their mission of a record-breaking defense road.

## `FUTURE BELT`

Miyu Amasaki is set to make her 4th defense of the Future Of Stardom title against Hina. Within the past 3 weeks, she has [defeated Azusa Inaba](https://youtu.be/pKmbOnO_eK0?si=13kkcQljCt5FgHO-) and [had a time limit draw against HANAKO](https://youtu.be/BSi1Qh3UCNk?si=CXBJP2HScHbJ8BoB) to retain the belt.

[![Miyu Amasaki pins Azusa Inaba to retain](https://i.postimg.cc/dtqd8GTG/20250125-miyu-win.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/3Wcdh41w)
[![Miyu Amasaki lies beside HANAKO after a time limit draw](https://i.postimg.cc/nhNCwmMR/20250212-miyu-hanako-draw.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/QFk8FHQ1)

These two used to be faction mates as part of Queen's Quest and had been separated away into different factions since the [forced split](https://youtu.be/NORVNf0r22U?si=ch3NvGNB_YqrObKE). Months later, Miyu [defeated Hina](https://www.youtube.com/live/pJ51tTb3T5g?si=STta2aUed8JyIChZ&t=3296) to seal her #1 contendership before winning the title from Rina last October.

[![20240929-miyu-wins-hina.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/nr1DyhNs/20240929-miyu-wins-hina.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/Fk7zcNrm)

Hina has failed to win with her 2 previous chances for this title against her two sisters (Hanan & Rina). Will the 3rd shot in her home crowd be the one?.

[![20250219-press-4-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/PJSFWtJn/20250219-press-4-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/0KJfx17V)

## `SYURI X KONAMI SAGA`

Konami made her return to STARDOM after being away for over a month [since DREAM QUEENDOM](https://youtu.be/-i8jbDO96qo?si=B_X7KLTo4A085MeM) by attacking Syuri again to continue her unfinished business. God's Eye's newest member Kiyoka Kotatsu previously fought Konami in last year's Bloodsport Bushido. Konami doesn't seem to remember who she is exactly.

[![20250202-syuri-konami.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XvyyV8T6/20250202-syuri-konami.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/67tQcdWM)

Since then, Syuri and Konami have been going back and forth in tag matches. The war between H.A.T.E. and God's Eye will continue in this show.

# KORAKUEN (MARCH 3)

The new Artist Of Stardom champions AZM, Starlight, and Miyu Amasaki are booked to make their 1st defense against Lady C, Tomoka Inaba, and Ranna Yagami of God's Eye. This came to be after Lady C pinned her former faction mate AZM on February 12 during a tag match.

[![20250303-artists.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bwF1073f/20250303-artists.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HrXJdPq6)

Mei Seira is also set to defend the High Speed title against Fukigen Death. Yuna Mizumori was originally going to be the expected challenger, until Fukigen beat her in a singles match.
