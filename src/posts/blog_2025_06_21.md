# `STORIES`

## <a id="iwgp">`THE STRONGEST MEET AGAIN`</a>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ff7SfkvGRv8?si=GW8KCkPyN_n-GUAi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the main event, Syuri will be defending the IWGP Women's championship against Sareee. This will also be the 3rd singles match between the two (and the most important one) and Sareee's 2nd attempt for the title after losing to Mayu Iwatani last year.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wRAQbMi.jpeg" alt="Syuri raises the IWGP Women's Championship belt and while shaking hands with Sareee">

Previously in March, [the two had a hard fought battle to determine the next challenger for the IWGP title which resulted in a time limit draw](https://youtu.be/pQ3j6ZzLxT4?si=860DpDa2Rci8OSvq). At that point, both women were in a rough point in their careers. Since losing to Mayu Iwatani for the IWGP title in January last year, Syuri didn't progress nor get any opportunities for gold as a singles competitor and focused more on rebuilding God's Eye. While Sareee won the [2024 Tokyo Sports award for the women's division](https://award.prowrestling.jp/2020s/2024/), she suffered 3 big losses at the start of the year, [losing the MARIGOLD World Title (to Utami Hayashishita)](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/329424), the [Beyond The Sea Title (to VENY)](https://wp.bbm-mobile.com/sp2/result/resultshow.asp?s=062355), and [got knocked down by a retiring Meiko Satomura](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/331625). This led to her dedicating the whole month of February just for training and took no wrestling bookings. Thus, this match between "the strongest" was supposed to serve as a comeback for both.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fgBBEMv.jpeg" alt="Referee Daichi raises both Syuri and Sareee's arms after their singles match resulting in a time limit draw">

A month after their encounter, Syuri took the lead had managed to dethrone Mayu and claim IWGP gold with Sareee watching it all closely from the front row and was already prepared to confront as the next challenger for the title.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/g3EuMxT.jpeg" alt="Sareee watches Syuri versus Mayu Iwatani in ASGQ with a serious look">

Sareee may have physically confronted Syuri and got her approval first, the shot was surprisingly already reserved behind the scenes by EVE's Alex Windsor which explained why she didn't get a reply back from STARDOM as [she impatiently confronted Syuri again weeks after ASGQ](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/344148) and left in anger as a reaction to a promise being broken.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i04I-0IegMxrTbx6muZ3EQZMoCT1kDAe/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Fortunately, Syuri successfully defended against Windsor in London (you can watch it on [YouTube for free](https://youtu.be/NUgXE8pOxVU?si=FPs5tzSOVbaFi1e7) and [STARDOM World](https://www.stardom-world.com/contents/7054)) and finalized the match with Sareee after returning to Japan. That same day, Sareee [taught Syuri's student Ranna Yagami a hard lesson of fighting spirit](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/347650).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GnPI11F.jpeg" alt="Sareee in the air about to land a vicious double foot stomp on Ranna Yagami who is flat on the mat">

It's time to settle it all.

Which of the strongest will set the global standard of the IWGP Women's championship from here?.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NMDEKZM.png">

## <a id="goddess">`BONDS`</a>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiAYhqMDz8w?si=y9IYpGguNb2x3QtR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

With Tam Nakano and Mayu Iwatani gone from STARDOM, STARS and COSMIC ANGELS (CA) have entered a new era. Hanan & Saya Iida have toppled FWC (Hazuki & Koguma) and sent them out of STARS as they start their leadership due to differences moving forward while Natsupoi & Saori Anou have began their 11th year in pro-wrestling now as the top 2 in CA.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CvhSLj7.jpeg">

The 4th defense for wing★gori's Goddesses Of Stardom title reign was decided after Natsupoi pinned Saya Iida on the 8th of June. Poi & Saori previously held the titles back in 2023 with 1 successful defense against Crazy Star (Suzu Suzuki & Mei Seira) before [having to vacate them due to Poi suffering a cervical hernia](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/283394) and forcing her out of action for a long while. They are taking back what was never lost.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uoi3lxY.jpeg">

Not only will this be a hot contest between two established tag teams, but also a test of strong leadership and the bonds that connect within the factions. One thing I've also heard mentioned specifically by Hanan was that this could also determine if STARS is still "the STARDOM army". The tag team record between these teams stands at 1-1-0 with 1 victory from wing★gori and 1 time limit draw during last year's tag league.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dgYwY5x.jpeg">

Will Poi & Saori finally get their first win against wing★gori and claim back what was theirs?

or

Will Hanan & Iida keep themselves at a strong position and lead STARS with ease into the future?

## <a id="ng-mvl">`NEO GENESIS x MI VIDA LOCA`</a>

<iframe width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AqXt474FhI?si=Y89_SmQA_C9SqY4C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The NEO GENESIS x Mi Vida Loca saga continues with both factions now having to clash in a no disqualification no touch rules (like a tornado/lucha tag) unit war. Anything goes with no count outs outside and tag partners don't need to touch to tag in.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jygAf1c.jpeg">

Since failing to capture the Artist belts, Suzu Suzuki tried to initiate faction warfare against NEO GENESIS who were not keen to accept at first. It wasn't until the 8th of June when NEO GENESIS took a big loss against H.A.T.E. with the returning Momo Watanabe picking up the win on AZM that could build into a potential NJPW Strong Women's title match.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oilsitA.jpeg">

Konami and Rina who just lost in the [same 3 way Artist match](https://www.youtube.com/live/lXzEHKo54ew?si=H-G_c1UzwVCGxE3-&t=5784) as Mi Vida Loca, have also kept their interest in the trios titles as well.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FuJXVnt.jpeg">

Suzu confronted NEO GENESIS backstage right after, making fun of the whole unit while asking for a proper rematch. Starlight Kid accepted and will try ensure this ends quickly with Suzu regretting leaving NEO GENESIS.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MWXnWab.jpeg">

Things could get very dangerous again as Suzu is still out for blood and may even unleash the same fate on Mei Seira.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1cBHoY.png">

## <a id="ami">`AMI SOUREI RETURNS`</a>

Ami Sourei is making her return to in-ring action for the first time since having to get surgery to treat a long-term ACL tear on her left knee last July. She also had to give her 5STAR Grand Prix spot to Ranna Yagami at that time.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gDd2hpC.jpeg">

That same month she started her long recovery, she watched in shock as Konami betray and humiliate Syuri from home, knowing she can't do anything about it.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LcFc8XK.png">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MFqjLsE.png">

Ami is here to avenge the damage caused by Konami and will try build back God's Eye.

## <a id="future">`FUTURE V3`</a>

<iframe width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euNsxaw2JRw?si=UOi-lbOBZO2RtKBP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

On her third defense of the Future Of Stardom title, Hina will be going against Rian.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vZPFMOm.jpeg">

Since making her pro debut last year in March against Starlight Kid, Rian had not won a singles match until she was given the opportunity recently by Hina. In a move intended to lift up the spirit of Rian, she tried to give her a shot for the Future Title. Akira Kurogane who debuted early this year, had already gotten her first singles win recently, and even pinned Rian in a tag match the month before. As a result, Hina called for a #1 contendership match between Rian and Akira.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ymKa8Bk.jpeg">

Days later, Rian had finally gotten her first singles victory all by herself and even revealed a new signature move called the "Hanaguruma" to finish off Akira.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LtpoP62uG0bUyvJ8wo9NJ3ZZBykN6A-8/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

At the [press conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWmLs61H88E?si=4vyIQnQL9qK8tiVc&t=1058), Hina stated that Rian has given a lot of thought into support ExV especially her seniors (Mina Shirakawa, Maika, and Xena), but not much on herself. Only Rian can change her wrestling after all. Rian gave off the impression that we are going see the new her tonight. If so, she'll have to prove it.

# `OTHER STORIES`

## <a id="nb">`NEW BLOOD TAG`</a>

In the next New Blood show on July 4, the current New Blood tag champs Rice & Bread (Waka Tsukiyama & HANAKO) will make their 4th defense against Momo Kohgo of STARS and rookie Yuria Hime.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KRc5rG3.jpeg">

On June 14, Yuria revealed her intention of wanting to join STARS and then requested Momo Kohgo to team up with her for the New Blood titles. This can also determine if she's going to be let into the faction or not.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e6AUN7q.jpeg">

She had also been training with the STARS crew for a while now and even posted some of the clips.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCVIvBxWfRnYIILi7D133487c9fq08Qm/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

## <a id="may-korakuen">`MAY KORAKUENS`</a>

During the month of May, STARDOM held 2 big Korakuen shows with a World and Wonder Of Stardom defense for the main events with theme on lower talent getting their first taste of competing for top gold. On the 11th of May, Saya Kamitani successfully defended the red belt for the 3rd time against Sayaka Kurara who used her Cinderella wish for a shot. Kamitani commended Kurara for her efforts, by saying that she doesn't need to replace someone and stick to being her. Kurara saw a glimpse of the Kamitani she respected, and left motivated to get back up. Things could get a little messy again with these two even though Tam Nakano is gone.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vK5OWXM.jpeg">

Ten days later, Starlight Kid successfully defeated HANAKO for her 4th defense of the Wonder Of Stardom Title. HANAKO earned her title shot after winning the pre-show rumble before All Star Grand Queendom. Like Kurara dedicating her fight for Tam, HANAKO did it for Mina Shirakawa who was also a white belt champ herself and even made use of her uraken and Maika's three consecutive brain busters. But the more experienced Starlight Kid who was smaller in size showcased her expertise to take down a giant.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTTN7Hf.jpeg">

The two new rookies named [Ema Maishima](https://wwr-stardom.com/fighters/emamaishima/) and [Kikyo Furusawa](https://wwr-stardom.com/fighters/furusawakikyo/) have also made their debuts earlier in the same show. Ema faced against the current NJPW Strong Women's champion AZM in an impressive high speed contest for a newcomer.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/scy7YRG.jpeg">

While Kikyo faced off against 1/2 of the Goddess champions Hanan showcasing good technical skill.

At a press conference on May 22, Sareee announced the matches for the next chapter of the Sareee-ISM series of produce shows. In the main event, the AAAW Tag Team champions Sareee & Takumi Iroha will team up against Saya Kamitani and Natsuko Tora in a special tag match. This will be Sareee's first encounter of the current World Of Stardom champion. Kamitani & Tora were picked as opponents by Sareee because they are a hot topic right now and she wants to familiarize herself with them in the ring while making them taste a real fight. They also want to make this match resemble Crush Girls vs the Atrocious Alliance with Takumi Iroha being a disciple of Chigusa Nagayo and Dump Matsumoto giving Tora the right to her continue her legacy.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B5N1QHe.jpeg">

The planned singles match between Natsupoi and Miku Kanae of T-Hearts will also happen in this show. This match was supposed to happen in March for Sareee-ISM Chapter VII, but was changed due to Poi injuring her ankle a week before. Saori Anou took her place instead that night to fight Miku.
