    [![20250308-miyu-ladyc.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/3NfX0050/20250308-miyu-ladyc.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/m1Mz0DrT)
    Lady C did not participate in the next show to recover from injuries (on her back).
- Tag Match
  - Maika & Mina Shirakawa defeated Natsuko Tora & Thekla via disqualification.
    [![20250308-thekla-maika.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xC5fRKd8/20250308-thekla-maika.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bDGfYSkf)
    She then attempted to physically assault Taro Okada. Pulling him out of his seat and landing on the floor, but Mina came in to beat Thekla.
    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lunjeKoJAGPsw6kfNVAf7YRKfrMp-gBz/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
    Mina then proposed a singles match against Thekla during the final day of the Cinderella. If Mina wins, Thekla has to apologize (possibly for the attacks by H.A.T.E. which included her getting injured) and has to pay her unpaid fines (from the suspensions). Otherwise, Thekla can freely choice whoever she wants to face one on one in the roster. From my assumption, her most likely pick would be Maika.

    Konami finished Starlight Kid after giving her 3 kicks on the head with the last blow being a punt kick to the face. Reminding SLK of that traumatic experience of her face getting smashed by Konami's powerful kick. But also hoping that match still goes as planned despite the damage done again.
    [![20250308_slk_dead.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ZKgPTNx1/20250308_slk_dead.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/svYGmv8c)
    Kamitani is already sick of Tam, excited to wipe her out of wrestling.

## <a id="sareee-ism-ch-seven">`Sareee-ISM Chapter VII (March 10)`</a>

Saori Anou defeated Miku Kanae (T-HEARTS) in the semi-final of Sareee-ISM Chapter VII.

[![20250310-saori-kanae-kick.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SKpJrWhb/20250310-saori-kanae-kick.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/5Xn49Qys)

Miku actually looked up to Anou as a wrestler in which she was happy to hear about and looks forward to meeting her again in the ring. She also dropped from what I've heard was a [Shohei Ohtani quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEg7uQgO3-w) about telling her to "stop aspiring to be her" as a form of advice.

<iframe width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffweM6WxSH0?si=nrhFlUiqJGbBjXMS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Natsupoi came out before to address the crowd about not being able to compete, then did the ring announcing duties for the match.

[![20250310-poi-sareeeism.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/152g8k7t/20250310-poi-sareeeism.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8QfDMTk)

In the main event, Syuri and Sareee had an intense singles match that resulted in a time limit draw (30 minutes). It was a match that was promoted as the battle between the strongest with both competitors aiming for the IWGP Women's Championship currently being held by Mayu Iwatani.

[![20250310-syuri-sareee-draw.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XY5rdstg/20250310-syuri-sareee-draw.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/DS2fKPvW)

Both do not want to lose to one another as they race to get their hands on Mayu. [Even willing to meet again 1-on-1 with one of them as the challenger and the other as IWGP Women's champion](https://web.archive.org/web/20250314110103/https://proresu-today.com/archives/263329/). Sareee specifically has set her goal to win the belt before 2025 comes to a close. [Going as far as to say that she will have the gold on her waist by the time she returns back to her ring](https://web.archive.org/web/20250312213111/https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/336793).

The archived VOD for the PPV is still available on [Sareee's website](https://sareeelive.com/store/11541) until the 24th (11:59PM JST). Expecting the Syuri x Sareee match to be released on [Sareee's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Sareee-SUNGOD/) or on STARDOM World in a month (along with Saori x Miku).

## <a id="sendai-girls">`SENDAI GIRLS`</a>

On the 10th, SENDAI GIRLS held a press conference in preparation for "The Top Of Joshi Wrestling" event happening in March 19. Aya Sakura will be challenging Chi Chi for the SENDAI GIRLS Junior Championship. Chi Chi previously defended the title against [Aya back in January during STARDOM's New Year Dream](https://youtu.be/eI6u4E_ACQw?si=Qsn_ulbiZnPxry_k), then beat [Ranna Yagami weeks later for her third defense](https://web.archive.org/web/20250211075344/https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/332292).

![Image of Aya Sakura and Chi Chi at the press conference for SENDAI GIRLS' The Top Of Joshi Wrestling](https://web.archive.org/web/20250315020408if_/https://wp.bbm-mobile.com/sp2/News/image.asp?i=00092454&C=News&ex=1&ci=00010&p=rl&cr=0&s=&uid=&tmpid=32946e37adca372fa58de33f560573d5)

Hai High Mate (Maika & HANAKO) will also be challenging Red Energy (Mika Iwata & Miyuki Takase) for the SENDAI GIRLS Tag Team Championship.

Both teams trash talked about how dull their wrestling is. It eventually exploded after Maika and HANAKO had drinks then Maika poured one on Iwata's face.

STARDOM had a fall count anywhere trios match between STARS (Mayu Iwatani, Hazuki, and Saya Iida) and NEO GENESIS (Starlight Kid, AZM, and Mei Seira) where they could bring in any item to use as a weapon. Unfortunately, Saya Iida did not show up, but instead we got Captain Stardom who brought in a giant sword.

[![20250310-iida.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FHq3yfPj/20250310-iida.png)](https://postimg.cc/4Y6YZ3Rd)

It was no match to Mei Seira's giant knife.
