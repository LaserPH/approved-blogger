## <a id="starlight-kid-vs-konami">`STARLIGHT KID VS KONAMI`</a>

The Wonder Of Stardom title match between Starlight Kid and Konami has been confirmed for the last day of the Cinderella Tournament on March 15.

[![Photo of Taro Okada presenting the signed contract for the Wonder Of Stardom title match between Starlight Kid and Konami.](https://i.postimg.cc/mkY2551V/20250304_slk_konami.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/QKM3BSbW)

Konami has been taking SLK into memory lane recently. Telling stories from their rookie days about having to get their own cold spray in the drug store, rushing to spray her with it when she loses, and training together in the dojo. She even brought some tea and a piece of bread that SLK really liked from the bakery.

[![Photo of Konami taunting Starlight Kid to eat the piece of bread she's holding.](https://i.postimg.cc/nh0MxgRP/20250304_press_conference_slk_konami_milkfrans.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/fVSMj2hc)

However, SLK's memories show a different light. She remembered a traumatic incident from June 9th of 2018, where Konami kicked her right on the face.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCQvupGfyPymTSM1m84BDg2xjBF8YS-0/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Calling her a psychopath who is just playing with her head. Bashing Konami by bringing up her limited success in singles competition, not having won a title despite both starting at the same year. Konami then started spraying her with party spray cans while congratulating her for being a champion.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-T5t7rFIWICdvGgSLpS4ETjXNgxtRbJ/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Also telling her to be careful this time, so her nose doesn't break off. SLK tried to retaliate with her right, but got boiled tea on it instead. Walking out unclean from a press conference for the 2nd time in a row as champion.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSMZe6QK1FHgiB-KQvbtfr1EtOLzq-CK/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

This will be their third singles encounter. An opportunity for Konami to finally win with her 5th shot and Starlight Kid to get her 1st win on her.

## <a id="saya-kamitani-vs-tam-nakano">`SAYA KAMITANI VS TAM NAKANO`</a>

The aftermath of the loser leaves STARDOM has concluded into a World Of Stardom title match where the loser has to retire in ALL STAR GRAND QUEENDOM on April 27. No one will be allowed at ring side to assist Tam nor Saya. For the time being leading into this match, Tam (who is now a freelancer) will still be taking part in STARDOM shows with a few exceptions until ASGQ (from my understanding of Okada's statements).

[![Photo of Tam Nakano and Saya Kamitani at the press conference](https://i.postimg.cc/kG3gwmGB/20250304_tam_saya.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/PpyHr0mj)

Tam was speaking emotionally about these turn of events and apologized to the fans whom have been saddened. STARDOM was her livelihood. Now that it has been taken away from her, she has decided to put her existence as a pro-wrestler on the line to fight one more time and rise back up. [Intending to do what it takes to sign another STARDOM contract if she survives](https://web.archive.org/web/20250307232642/https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/336128).

[![Photo of Tam Nakano holding a microphone while tears are running down her face.](https://i.postimg.cc/15Szqsbd/20250304_tam.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/py0xNbWQ)

Lots of people were wondering why Saya also decided to put her career on the line along with the red belt. [Since Tam put hers on the line as she gave her one "last chance", as someone who has devoted their life to this industry, it was fair for her to do so as well. She also thought that the "loser leaves STARDOM" match wasn't enough to the job. Aiming to send Tam further down into levels where she could never recover from and continue her mission to spread pro-wrestling in her own evil way](https://web.archive.org/web/20250307232736/https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/336246).

The last time a match of this type occurred in Japanese women's pro-wrestling was back in 1979 in a WWWA World title bout between Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda of the very popular Beauty Pair. The predecessors to the Crush Gals (Lioness Asuka & Chigusa Nagayo).

As Tam said, [one will fall down to the depths of hell, while the other reaches heaven](https://web.archive.org/web/20250307232642/https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/336128).

Most of this has been copy-pasted from the previous blog with a few updates.

Momo Watanabe is scheduled to face against Mercedes Mone in AEW's Revolution PPV on March 9 for the TBS Championship.

[![Graphic for Mercedes Mone versus Momo Watanabe TBS Championship match for AEW's Revolution 2025 PPV](https://i.postimg.cc/htG9dD80/20250309-mone-momo-aew.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC6j8tPs)

Last time they 1 on 1 was back in [August for the NJPW Strong Women's title during Capital Collision](https://youtu.be/gMJbLES1yXI?si=KN5B9kxRYgGTJa_E&t=1200). Since then, Momo Watanabe has won the International Women's Cup during Wrestle Dynasty while Mone has been on a roll as a dominant multi-crown champion.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfbMQjMlR2oe6KZ0-CX0Sdlqsp3J7soL/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Momo made an appearance during AEW Grand Slam Australia sitting in the front row as Mone fought Harley Cameron. Also scouting ROH Women's World Champion Athena whom she pinned in Wrestle Dynasty.

[![Photo of Momo Watanabe clapping from the crowd as she watched Mone wrestled in Australia.](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCgtN3Q/20250215-momo-aew-roh.png)](https://postimg.cc/jLRPgTBR)

Days later on Dynamite, Momo sent her official challenge at Revolution to "stop the Mone train". Mone insisted that she should show up next Wednesday and say it to her face.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z8hXlxfrOq90WgupYBzSI2zcgmTnt5c/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

And she did.

Even sent a message thru Billie Starkz later on Collision.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tiAks3WgiKtmcwahjD4U8ifNriECDziv/preview" width="600" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

But before Momo fights Mone, she will first go against Serena Deeb on tomorrow.

The Revolution PPV can be purchased via [Triller TV](https://www.trillertv.com/watch/aew-revolution-2025/2pghk/). A [bundle for Revolution and the upcoming Dynasty event](https://www.trillertv.com/watch/aew-2025-pack-1-revolution-dynasty/2pghl/) is also available for purchase.

## <a id="sendai-girls-senjo">`SENDAI GIRLS (SENJO)`</a>

Hai High Mate (Maika and HANAKO) have challenged the SENDAI GIRLS Tag Team champions Red Energy (Mika Iwata & Miyuki Takase) for March 19th's "The Top Of Joshi Wrestling" which will be streamed live on [WRESTLE UNIVERSE](https://www.wrestle-universe.com/en/lives/7MHNBXHheGAfAR3VYxZWQn) (6:30 PM JST).

[![20250319-senjo.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NM9FkGQq/20250319-senjo.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/ZBmJTS9V)

Both appeared on screen with a pre-taped video calling them out and stated that since they have [beaten 200Kg (Chihiro Hashimoto & Yuu)](https://youtu.be/zChYiRgAVeU?si=YXjiOUJvVh8xa_BC) recently, so they are qualified to challenge for the belts.

[![20250209-hhmate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ryYZmH23/20250209-hhmate.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/K4BDpJzD)

Maika & Natsupoi recently teamed up to take on Chihiro Hashimoto & Manami on March 1st. Hashimoto went to STARDOM's show in Sendai on Feb 22 to challenge Hai High Mate for a match right as Maika was talking about winning in SENJO and even giving the best of luck to Aya Sakura who will be facing Chi Chi once again for their Junior title.

[![20250319-aya-chi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BQc6gVf6/20250319-aya-chi.png)](https://postimg.cc/Xpq4NxJS)

However, HANAKO was not available for March 1st because of the title match in New Blood 19. As a result, Natsupoi voluntarily stepped in as Maika's partner. Poi herself has fought Hashimoto in both [SENDAI GIRLS](https://youtu.be/P_XfoYZVjb4?si=NCpEpkiysypocrbY) and [STARDOM](https://youtu.be/iE_11NuvAIs?si=RbpmJAtxFkJSBPEJ) before already.

The VOD for March 1 can be viewed in [WRESTLE UNIVERSE](https://www.wrestle-universe.com/en/videos/k14zD6B7pWrYgk6u9KcCXt).

## <a id="wave">`WAVE`</a>

Saya Kamitani made her 2nd defense of the Regina di Wave title against Yumi Ohka on March 2nd. Ohka was the first person to ever hold the title back in 2013.

Shin Sakura Hirota came out as Meiko Satomura and attempted to be the next challenger. GAMI already decided on POP Wrestling Champion Honoka for Kamitani's next defense for April 1 before her 2nd anniversary since her debut.
