## <a id="loser-leaves-stardom">`LOSER LEAVES STARDOM`</a>

After defeating Saya Kamitani in a high-stakes tag match that saw Sayaka Kurara reject the Phenex Queen, Tam finally proposed her earned wish.

[![20250224-saya-kurara-reject.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy0ckBxQ/20250224-saya-kurara-reject.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FkNdBbWT)

It wasn't another opportunity for the World Of Stardom title, but a "loser leaves STARDOM" match. Tam acknowledged Saya's "own love" for pro-wrestling, but completely opposed her ways of doing so. Reminding people again the foulness of how Kamitani won the World Of Stardom title from her. Treating their 10th official singles encounter as their final confrontation to end it all, Kamitani agreed on this match and set their battle for March 3 in Korakuen Hall.

[![20250224-saya-tam.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Bt9xFHgL/20250224-saya-tam.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bSgDcG4p)

Tam has gone insane as this chapter of their rivalry continued and couldn't take it anymore. The Kamitani doll she made out of hatred after DREAM QUEENDOM has its tongue completely grown out of proportion to the point that it's wrapped around Tam's neck almost choking her when she wakes up. Furthermore, she's thought about a recommendation for Kamitani's new destination. Going back with her former Queen's Quest partner Utami Hayashishita over in the flower fields (MARIGOLD) to "save her". She thinks that the root cause of all this evil was when Utami left Queen's Quest then STARDOM and it would be best if they reunited. The notion that Kamitani has chosen this path of evil isn't new as she [herself has even brought it up as a factor in past statements](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/311110).

[![20250226-tam-doll-tongue.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L4ZQJT4s/20250226-tam-doll-tongue.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sjkf5cM0)

On the other side, Kamitani reacted angrily to these comments bringing up Utami Hayashishita. She may have been also surprised with the stipulation chosen for this grudge match, but they've admitted that her own ways have caused this and is here to finish the job. Picturing that same crying Tam from the aftermath of last year's DREAM QUEENDOM who will now regret her choice. Not backing down as a STARDOM-born professional wrestler the thought of having to leave the organization, compared to Tam, who is willing to leave in a sportsmanlike fashion.

[![20250224-saya-tam-hair.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8kq34YXW/20250224-saya-tam-hair.png)](https://postimg.cc/MXmdK9SK)

During a talk show held by Bushiroad, [STARDOM president Taro Okada answered questions regarding this match by saying that the wrestlers involved were prepared to make a decision and as a result, they will go with it despite hearing opinions from fans](https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/335767?page=1). Wanting the fans to witness the conclusion whatever it may be and are ready to take full responsibility. When it comes to other upcoming events such as Tam's upcoming show in Anjo (Aichi), they are going to ensure it will go as planned. Tam who was also present as a guest, tried to cool down the concerns while also defended STARDOM as an organization from bad comments in relation to this. As this was going, Kamitani stormed in with a chair and attacked Tam. Already excited to send Tam out.

Will this truly be the big end of this rivalry?

Who will end up carrying STARDOM on their backs?

## <a id="artist-of-stardom-title">`ARTIST OF STARDOM TITLE`</a>

The new Artist Of Stardom champions AZM, Starlight, and Miyu Amasaki are set to make their 1st defense against the God's Eye trio of Lady C, Tomoka Inaba, and Ranna Yagami.

[![20250303-artists.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bwF1073f/20250303-artists.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/HrXJdPq6)

On the 12th, Lady C managed to get the big win for God's Eye against NEO GENESIS after pinning AZM, her former faction mate from Queen's Quest. She thanked God's Eye for making her stronger and is now aiming to get the 3 count one more time on AZM to win the belts.

Initially, Yuna Mizumori called for her shot on the title if she beats Fukigen Death on their singles match. She failed. Now Fukigen Death is the #1 contender.

Both appeared on screen with a pre-taped video calling them out and stated that since they have [beaten 200Kg (Chihiro Hashimoto & Yuu)](https://youtu.be/zChYiRgAVeU?si=YXjiOUJvVh8xa_BC) recently, so they are qualified to challenge for the belts.

[![20250209-hhmate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ryYZmH23/20250209-hhmate.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/K4BDpJzD)

Maika & Natsupoi recently teamed up to take on Chihiro Hashimoto & Manami on March 1st. Hashimoto went to STARDOM's show in Sendai on Feb 22 to challenge Hai High Mate for a match right as Maika was talking about winning in SENJO and even giving the best of luck to Aya Sakura who will be facing Chi Chi once again for their Junior title.

[![20250319-aya-chi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BQc6gVf6/20250319-aya-chi.png)](https://postimg.cc/Xpq4NxJS)
